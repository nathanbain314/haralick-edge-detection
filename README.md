Optimization of Haralick edge detection algorithm

This code is an optimization of [this code](https://github.com/haldos/edges) and based on [this accompanying paper](http://www.ipol.im/pub/art/2015/35/). The original code was apparently written only to show the idea of the algorithm with little concern for efficiency, so for the final project for my Programming for Performance class I optimized from running in 8.287 seconds to only 0.379 seconds.
