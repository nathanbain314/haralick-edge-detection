First run compile.sh
It works on stampede machines, but if you want it to work on ut cs machines you need to identify a directory.
Just copy one of files to ../src/test_haralick and run compile.sh in that directory

CMakeLists.txt does not have machine optimizations. Some files require the CMakeLists.txt in files directory to use CMakeListsOpt.txt, renamed as CMakeLists.txt

delta.c is a change in the algorithm
vector.c is my attempt at vectorization
optimizedbest.c is the further optimized program
threadOpt.c is the first attempt at using threads
threadAffinity.c sets threads to cores

Just about the only changes in each file are near the end, in the main loop.
